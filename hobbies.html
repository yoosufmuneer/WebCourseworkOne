            <p> Music is always entertaining to listen to. I spend most of my free time listening to music in the background and I'm very much into hip hop. Most of the contents are rather grimy but they provide insight into the difficulties that each artist had to overcome. Substance is one of the main properties that attract me towards, they can really change my views on certain areas.
            </p>
            <p>My favourite hip hop acts include Kanye West, Jay-Z, J.I.D and Nas. They're incredibly unique in their art sonically and in the topics they cover which range from lesser known African American history to financial education in making decisions.</p>

            <p>I find documentaries to be way more insteresting that movies for example. They're very informative and I find myself watching them often. My favourites topics include history, science and nature. They can range anywhere from a simple five minute video to hours and hours. Documentaries are a great way to spend free time since they're informative.

            <!--Pseudo element is used to add single quotation marks to the text wrapped in the <q> tags-->
            <p><q>Planet Earth</q> documentary by BBC stands out because of it's beautiful cinematography and great narration by David Attenborough. I'd highly
            recommend it for anyone. I've started watching a documentary on the Pacific ocean garbage cleanup mission, It's quite interesting.</p>
